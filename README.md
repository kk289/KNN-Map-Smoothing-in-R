# KNN-Map-Smoothing-in-R
KNN Map Smoothing in R

# Purpose
# For Commercial Package Policies (CPP), wwe plan on building 3 sepearate models by line of business

# Liability
# Property - Group II
# Property - Group I and Special Cause of Loss (all non-Group II)
# The first step in this process was to build the modeling dataset. This information can be found in the _Input_ section below. The following steps contain the scope of this

# Creation of R dataset from SAS file (A future iteration will have CPP code generated in R)
# Exploratory Statistics
# Modeling Code
# Model Output/Validation
# Filing Support
# Input
# We will use the file, _CPP_modeling_data_, located in F:\CorpHQ\SAS_DATA_Reporting\BRE6322\CPP\Models\2018\v1.0.0\GL\data\GL\DATA_SAS The code used to generate this file, *CPP_GL_DATA.egp*, can be found in I:\Team Drives\CL Predictive Modeling\models\2018\cpp\1.0.0 In the future, we plan on replacing this code with R.

# Readme Future
# Once more code has been built out, the readme will contain more info on the order of which files need to be run.
